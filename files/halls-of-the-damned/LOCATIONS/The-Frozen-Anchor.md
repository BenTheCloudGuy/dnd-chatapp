Frosthaven, a rough and tumble port city located in the northernmost reaches of Vaasa, right along the River Pelauvir. Known for its hardy population and strategic location, Frosthaven serves as a vital trade hub between the harsh northern wilderness and the more civilized regions to the south.



The Frozen Anchor in Frosthaven
The players find themselves seated at a heavy, oak table in the Frozen Anchor, one of the more reputable inns in Frosthaven, despite the rough edges. It’s noon, but the thick clouds overhead and the cold wind sweeping through the city give the day a muted, overcast light. Winter is nipping at the heels of autumn, and even at this time of day, the cold bites through the thickest coats, and frost clings to the windows. The innkeeper has built a roaring fire in the large hearth, and the flames crackle loudly, fighting back the chill that has begun to creep into the northern reaches of Vaasa.

The scent of roasted meat and spiced ale fills the air, mingling with the muted sounds of conversation. Most patrons are huddled close to the fire, seeking warmth and comfort from the cold outside. 

The talk of armed conflict in Damara and the unrest along the river fills the air, with rumors of rebellion and strange creatures plaguing the region. 

Give the Players a chance to interact with some of the patrons to learn of the rumors and interact with the NPCs and a chance to introduce each other…

Enter Captain Reaven and Selene
As the players settle into the warm comfort of the inn, the door swings open, letting in a gust of cold wind, which sends a shiver through the room. Two figures step inside. The first is a Tabaxi with sleek silver fur, her green eyes flashing in the firelight. She moves with a predatory grace, each step measured and deliberate.  Her gaze sweeps the room as though she’s sizing up the patrons. By her side is a young and beautiful half-elf woman with a more reserved demeanor, her eyes quietly scanning the crowd. 

You hear whispers of "Emerald Eyes" and "Captain Reaven" 

Reaven strides confidently toward the bar, her voice cutting through the murmur of conversation. "I’m looking for some able hands," she says, loud enough for everyone to hear. "The Sea Spray is sailing south along the river, and I need a crew that can handle the trouble ahead. If you’re looking for work—and aren’t afraid of a bit of danger—come talk to me." - Selene stays a step behind her, giving a small, enigmatic smile to those who make eye contact.

She points to Vera, what of you Vera? You are always handy in a fight? {Vera declines, saying she has had her fill of fighting in Damara.. The King has gone too far..}  -- She then looks at the players.. 


Setting the Hook
Captain Reaven’s bold offer immediately draws the attention of a few nearby patrons. She’s offering passage and work aboard the Sea Spray, a sleek, fast ship known for making dangerous journeys. But her words also carry a warning: the route south is fraught with peril, and anyone who joins her crew will need to be ready to face more than just bad weather.
