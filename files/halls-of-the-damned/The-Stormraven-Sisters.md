# The Tragic Legacy of the Stormraven Sisters #

## The Stormraven Lineage ##

Long before Strahd's dark dominion swallowed Barovia, the Stormraven family was one of the region’s most respected noble houses. Renowned for their martial prowess and unwavering loyalty, the Stormravens were sworn to the Von Zarovich family, serving as elite knights, battle-mages, and assassins. Their family crest, a black raven with crimson eyes, was known throughout the land—a symbol of both honor and fear.
Among their lineage, three sisters—Elandra, Seraphine, and Kaelin Stormraven—rose above all others, earning fame as the Ravens of War. Together, they were an unstoppable force on the battlefield, leading Strahd’s armies in his mortal years as he waged his bloody campaigns to solidify his rule.

- Elandra, the eldest, was a masterful warrior, wielding her greatsword with deadly precision. She fought with a cold, unwavering resolve, leading charges with an iron will.
- Seraphine, the middle sister, was a gifted necromancer, her magic powerful enough to turn the tide of battle. Whispers said she had been born touched by death itself.
- Kaelin, the youngest, was an unmatched assassin, a shadow in the night. Her victims never saw her coming until it was far too late.

Their loyalty to Strahd was absolute. They followed him into battle, into victory, and ultimately—into damnation.


## The Fall of the Stormraven Sisters ##

When Strahd's lust for power drove him to make his fateful pact with the Dark Powers of the Amber Temple, the sisters followed without hesitation. They stood at his side on the night he seized Castle Ravenloft, aiding him in slaughtering his enemies and securing his throne.
But they did not anticipate what he had become. That night, when Strahd descended upon his own soldiers and feasted upon their blood, the sisters hesitated for the first time. Even their loyalty wavered as they realized their master was no longer a man, but something else—something monstrous.

Strahd, sensing their doubt, gave them a choice:

```txt
    "Swear yourselves to me once more, body and soul, and I will grant you the gift of eternity. Or resist, and die as all the others did."
    
    Elandra was the first to kneel, her oath still binding her to the Von Zarovich name. She had given everything for Strahd’s cause—she would not turn away now.
    Seraphine, ever fascinated by the secrets of undeath, saw an opportunity for power beyond anything she had known. She embraced the darkness willingly, eager to explore the limits of her newfound immortality.
    Kaelin, however, was not so quick to yield. The youngest sister had always been the most independent, the one who could vanish into the night without a trace. She tried to flee. She did not make it far. Strahd hunted her down himself, cornering her in the depths of Castle Ravenloft. When he found her, he did not strike her down. 
    
    Instead, he whispered: "You of all should know, little bird—there is no escaping the shadows."

    And so, she too was turned, her resistance shattered, her will remade in Strahd’s image. That night, the Stormraven Sisters were reborn—not as warriors of honor, but as enforcers of the Count’s will.
```

## The Stormraven Sisters as Servants of Strahd ##

Now, as undead creatures bound to Strahd’s eternal reign, the sisters serve as his personal executioners and enforcers. They are whispered of in fearful tones, known as the Stormraven Daughters of the Night.
- Elandra, the Bloodblade: The warrior wraith, her greatsword infused with the hunger of a predator. She leads Strahd’s forces when open battle is required, cutting down his enemies with cold efficiency.
- Seraphine, the Deathbinder: The necromancer, weaving her spells in the name of her dark master. She gathers and controls the dead, ensuring none escape Strahd’s dominion.
- Kaelin, the Shadowfang: The assassin, the unseen hand that deals in whispers and poison. She hunts those who defy Strahd, ensuring none escape the mists of Barovia alive.

Though they have long since given themselves to darkness, a small ember of their past selves still lingers in the deepest parts of their minds. In fleeting moments of solitude, they wonder—did they choose this fate? Or had Strahd’s will already claimed them long before that fateful night? But such thoughts are dangerous. And so they bury them, drowning them in blood, steel, and the cold embrace of eternity. For they are the Stormraven Sisters, and the will of Strahd is all that remains.

## Attack at the Old Abbey ##

GM Narration: Servants of the Dark Lord

As you tread deeper into the fog-shrouded forest of Barovia, the ever-present mist coils around your legs like grasping fingers. The air is thick with an unnatural chill, and every breath feels like it draws in more than just cold—something darker, something watching. Then, a whisper—silken and cruel—slips through the trees.

``` "You do not belong here..." ```

The voice, filled with ancient malice, is followed by the rustling of unseen figures. Three shapes emerge from the shadows, their forms elegant yet deadly. The flickering torchlight reveals porcelain skin, too pale to be natural, and eyes that burn with the feral hunger of the undead. These are no ordinary vampires.

These are the Stormraven Sisters, Strahd’s enfrcers—warriors and assassins bound by blood and servitude to their Dark Lord. 

The eldest, Elandra Stormraven, steps forward first, clad in blackened armor, her greatsword humming with dark energy. Her voice is smooth, authoritative, and filled with quiet menace.

```
"You have trespassed where you should not. Strahd does not suffer fools... nor does he suffer prey that does not know its place."
```

Behind her, Seraphine Stormraven raises a hand, and the mist around her darkens, thickening into a swirling vortex of necrotic energy. Her lips curl in amusement as she gazes upon you with a predator’s patience.

```
"How delightful. I can already hear the sound of your heartbeat slowing."
And then—she is gone. Kaelin Stormraven, the youngest, vanishes into the mist, her laughter a whisper against your ear. 

"Run, little mice… it will only make the hunt more exciting."
```

Then, with a blur of motion, they strike.

- Shadow Strike (Kaelin) – Kaelin strikes from the shadows, her daggers gleaming with venomous magic.
