The Evening Wanes
As the evening begins to fall, the temperature plummets, and the first few flakes of snow begin to drift lazily from the sky, settling on the deck and vanishing into the dark waters of the river. Gorak BrokenTusk, the ship's first mate, takes the helm, his broad form silhouetted against the darkening sky as the rest of the crew prepares for the night. His gruff voice calls out orders, and you can hear the occasional grunt of exertion as the crew adjusts the sails to catch what little wind remains.

The ship’s gentle rocking and the rhythmic sounds of the river begin to lull you into a sense of calm. The specters in the mist feel like a distant memory now, though their presence lingers in your mind like an itch you can’t quite scratch.

Below deck, the small quarters offer some warmth from the cold, the faint glow of lanterns casting long shadows on the wooden walls. You find your bunks, tired from the day's journey, and prepare to rest. The creaking of the ship, the faint murmur of the crew above, and the distant sound of the river are the last things you hear as sleep begins to claim you.

A few hours past midnight.. Something wakes you, there’s a sudden stillness. A quiet that feels… wrong. You strain your ears, but after a few tense moments, the sounds of the ship return—faint, but steady. You know that Gorak, ever watchful, is above, steering the ship through the night. You tell yourself that the ghosts of the Bloodstone Pass are behind you now, but a part of you can’t help but wonder …  


Read to everyone:
Without warning, the ship shudders violently beneath you, hurling you from your bunks as icy water floods into the hold as the bow of the ship smashes in around you. The shock of the cold water hits you like a slap to the face as it comes pouring into the cabin. The water quickly snuffs out the lamps plunging the cabin into pitch blackness. 

You scramble to your feet, your breath visible in the freezing air. All around you, you hear the creaking of the ship’s timbers, strained by the impact. From above deck, the distant sounds of —screams, screeches, and the clash of steel—mix with the ominous groans of the ship. You need to find a way out, and fast.

Emergence on Deck

Read the following:
    After battling your way through the freezing, rising water and stumbling over debris, you finally find the stairs and push yourself towards the hatch. As you break free onto the deck, the scene before you is one of pure chaos. Leathery-winged creatures dive and shriek, their screeches piercing the thick fog that surrounds the ship. Captain Revean darts between the monsters, her blades flashing in the dim light as she fights with deadly precision. Nearby, First Mate Gorak, massive and terrifying, swings a huge anchor with deadly force. His broken tusk gleams in the dim light as he roars commands to the crew. A huge bloody gash shows that these creatures are not to be toyed with. Toward the bow, lanterns knocked over in the chaos have sparked small fires that threaten to spread, casting a grim, flickering light across the battlefield. And with that, let's roll for initiative shall we.
