# A Call for Aid #

As the players and crew manage to fend off the attack by the Night Screamers, they hear a voice calling out of the woods. From the mist shrouded woods two figures emerge. One leaning heavily on the other to the of nearly being dragged by the larger man. 


GM Narration:
As the last screech of the Night Screamers fades into the night, the chaos aboard the Sea Spray slowly subsides. The deck is a wreck of broken wood, scattered supplies, and the blood of the wounded. The fires from the ship’s lanterns cast an eerie glow through the fog that clings to the coastline, the orange light flickering in and out like the last breaths of the dying ship. All that remains is the heavy silence of aftermath—the distant crash of waves and the creaking of the ship’s strained timbers, settling into the rocky shore.

Then, out of the fog that rolls in from the mist-shrouded woods, a voice cuts through the oppressive quiet—a strong, desperate voice, filled with authority and urgency: 
    
    "In the name of King Frostmantle, I call for aid!"

The plea seems to hang in the air for a moment, the mist swirling and obscuring the source. As your eyes search the fog, two shadowy figures emerge. One of them, a smaller man, is leaning heavily on the larger one, his legs barely supporting his own weight. The larger figure moves with grim determination, dragging the wounded man forward with each heavy step.

As they come closer, the firelight reveals more. The larger man is clad in battered armor, streaked with blood and dirt. His face is lined with exhaustion. The man he supports is younger, his body slumped, and his once-fine clothing torn and drenched in blood. He clutches his side where a deep wound festers, his face pale, his breathing shallow and labored.

The larger man raises his head and, through the fog, you see the unmistakable symbols of Damaran royalty on their cloaks, though tattered and weathered. As they draw nearer, the desperate urgency in his voice returns: 

    "Please... in the name of the King... help us."

Suggested Player Prompts:
    • The players will likely rush to help or inquire more. They might want to make Perception or Medicine checks to discern more about the situation.
    • Perception Check (DC 15): The players notice the intricate sigil of House Frostmantle on the younger man's cloak, indicating that these are no ordinary travelers.
    • Medicine Check (DC 12): The young man is gravely wounded, with a festering wound in his side, likely from a blade. His condition is dire and will require immediate treatment.

As the players close the distance, the larger figure carefully lowers the wounded man to the ground. His voice trembles with exhaustion but still holds the authority of a man used to giving orders:

    "This is Prince Ian Frostmantle. He is gravely injured... We were ambushed... I am Lord Geoffrey Frostmantle, his uncle. Please, we need your help to get him to safety."

Lord Geoffrey looks up at you with pleading eyes, his hands trembling as he wipes the sweat and blood from his brow. His voice is hoarse, the weight of his words hanging heavy in the mist:

    "They came out of nowhere—undead... led by a knight in dark armor. We were overwhelmed. I... I couldn’t save them all. But the Prince… he cannot fall. The Kingdom needs him."
    


As the healer in the party reaches out to mend Prince Ian Frostmantle's grievous wounds, something unsettling occurs. The healer’s magic, usually so responsive, feels repelled, as if meeting an impenetrable wall of darkness and primal malevolence. Determined to save the young prince, the healer pushes harder—and that’s when it happens.
Without warning, the Prince's hand snaps up and seizes the healer’s wrist, his grip unnaturally strong despite his weakened state. 

In that instant, the world around the healer shifts:

The Visions
All colors, senses, and smells are muted as the Shadowfell has consumed these worlds fully.

World 1 – 1st Heartbeat:
You find yourself standing on a barren, wind-swept overlook. Above you, three moons of varying sizes hang in the sky, with a larger planet sitting low on the horizon, its muted greys, oranges, and browns casting a strange light across the desolate landscape. The rocks below your feet have been scorched, and the valley before you is filled with the sun-bleached remains of thousands of the dead. Battle standards are scattered within the piles, and among the bones, you see creatures whose forms are almost too large to comprehend.

As you kneel to examine the bones, you realize that they belong to beings much larger than initially thought—nearly 10 feet tall, with four fingers on each hand and large, strangely shaped heads. Their weapons, including massive bows, look like they could have been wielded by giants.

As you continue to survey the scene, a chill runs down your spine. You sense something behind you. Before you can turn to see, your vision blurs and you are thrust into another reality.

World 2 – 2nd Heartbeat:
The scene changes abruptly. You are now inside the remains of a ruined room, the air thick with dust and decay. You brace yourself against a cracked white wall, your eyes drawn to the far side of the room where a shattered window takes up nearly the entire wall. Beyond the window, a sky tinged in the dull red of a burning atmosphere stretches across a landscape filled with the crumbling ruins of what was once a massive city of glass and steel.

The shattered towers stand like skeletal remains, some as tall as mountains, all bathed in the red glow of the burning atmosphere. Low on the horizon, a shattered moon hangs ominously, its pieces occasionally falling and burning up in the atmosphere.

Your attention is pulled to the remains of two adults holding tightly to a small child. Their bodies are human, but they wear strange clothing—clothing unlike anything you’ve seen before. They seem to have died protecting the child from whatever catastrophe befell this world.

As you stare at the child’s lifeless face, you once again feel eyes upon you. This time, a voice echoes in your mind:

    "Who dares intrude on my madness?"

The vision fades, and you are plunged into the next.

World 3 – 3rd Heartbeat:
Your vision shifts again, and you find yourself floating in a void of darkness, the Abysal Sea. Stars blink in and out, scattered across the spectrum of every imaginable color. There, before you, bright orbs of white light slowly fade into existence, staring at you—through you. The sensation is overwhelming as this essence attempts to enter your mind. 

Wisdom Save (DC 15-20): Do you resist it entering your mind?
    • Resist: You feel a mix of anger, shock, and dark humor as the presence mocks you.
"You are foolish to think you can resist!"
    • Fail: A searing voice fills your mind.
"You will serve the Chained God as countless others have. You will learn not to resist your new God!"
As you fall to one knee, pain flares through your body.

Wisdom Save (DC 25): Do you continue to resist?
    • Resist: A vision of a creature with four glowing white eyes standing among the stars and planets fills your mind. Its enormity is beyond comprehension. But as it reaches for you, another force intervenes—a protective presence, shielding you from the creature’s oppressive aura. This being’s presence fills you with a sense of power and safety, and you feel yourself falling back into its embrace.
    • Fail: You collapse to your knees, clutching your head in agony. As your screams fill the void, you feel the hand of the Chained God touch your shoulder, and everything fades to black as you fall into the abyss.

Consequence:
    • Exhaustion: The Cleric takes 1 level of Exhaustion unless both Wisdom saves are passed.
    • Failure: Failing one check results in Exhaustion. Failing both checks results in both Exhaustion and Insanity, the latter leading to lasting mental effects.

As the healer snaps back to reality, they are left gasping for breath. The Prince releases his grip, collapsing back into unconsciousness, but his fevered mumbling continues.

The Request
As the adrenaline from the battle with the Night Screamers fades, Lord Geoffrey approaches you, his face etched with exhaustion and concern. He glances down at the gravely wounded Prince Ian, then back at you and the crew of the Sea Spray, his voice hoarse but resolute.

    "I have no more men to give..." he says, pausing to gather his strength. "I must take the Prince to safety. His life... He is too important."

His eyes harden as he looks toward the thick mist that still shrouds the forest beyond the shipwreck.

     "But the darkness spreading across the land... it must be stopped at its source. I need you to go to Valls. Mistress Clarissa Allyson knows the truth about what has happened. Find her. She will know what to do, how to stop this madness."


Geoffrey reaches into his tunic and pulls out a piece of parchment, writing hastily with a shaky hand. After folding the letter, he presses a ring—a heavy signet ring bearing the symbol of House Frostmantle—into the wax, sealing the letter. He hands it to you, his gaze steady.

    "This will show her that you act on my behalf, and that she can trust you. I know this is a heavy burden, but if you fail... if this evil is allowed to spread unchecked... all of Damara will fall."

He looks at you one final time, eyes filled with both hope and desperation.

     "Will you do this? Will you carry out this task in the name of the Crown?"

As Lord Geoffrey finishes speaking, Captain Reaven, her silver-furred face weary but determined, steps forward. Her emerald eyes scan the wreckage of the Sea Spray, and with a swift nod to her first mate, Gorak, she reaches into a leather satchel slung across her back.

    "Before we part ways," she says, her voice steady and sharp as the wind off the river, "you'll need to be at your best for what lies ahead. The Sea Spray's been through worse than this, and while we salvage what we can, I've found something that may help you all."

She pulls out several vials, each filled with a glowing red liquid. 

    "Healing potions," she explains, holding them up. "Take one each. Consider it a gift... or perhaps an investment. If you lot are heading into that cursed city, you’re going to need every bit of help you can get."

    One by one, she hands each of you a vial, the liquid inside swirling with the promise of renewed strength. "Use them wisely," she says, "I can't promise we'll meet again, but if you make it out of this, I'll be waiting for you back at the capital."
    
    She pauses for a moment, her gaze shifting to the fog-covered woods. "Stay alive out there. And remember: you have allies here."
