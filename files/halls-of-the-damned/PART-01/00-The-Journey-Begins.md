The Sea Spray sets off from Frosthaven under a leaden gray sky. The brisk winter wind bites at your skin, and the river’s surface ripples with the cold breeze. The crew moves with precision and confidence, adjusting the sails as Captain Reaven stands at the helm, her emerald eyes scanning the horizon. The first few days pass quietly, with little more than the constant creak of the ship’s hull and the gentle lapping of the river against its sides to keep you company.

The river itself is broad and winding, lined with towering cliffs and dark, dense forests that seem to press in from both sides. The weather turns colder with each passing day, the air heavy with the promise of snow. You find the chill seeping into your bones, and more than once you huddle near the ship's small brazier for warmth.

Allow the Players to explain what they were doing over the last 3 days. 


Passing the Bloodstone Pass
On the third evening, the Bloodstone Pass comes into view. High cliffs rise on either side of the river, casting long shadows over the water as the sun begins to sink. The air feels different here—heavier, more oppressive. The jagged rocks loom above you, their surfaces slick with ice and frost, and the wind seems to howl in eerie, unsettling tones as it whips through the narrow gorge.
As the Sea Spray cuts through the river, the water takes on an oily, dark hue, reflecting the twilight sky. Mist begins to creep in, swirling around the ship like a living thing, clinging to the shores and the bases of the cliffs. Gorak, standing at the bow, grunts softly as he keeps a vigilant eye on the darkening landscape.

In the distance, just beyond the reach of your vision, shapes move through the mist along the riverbanks—pale figures, spectral and wavering, barely more than shadows. Their movements are slow and deliberate, fading in and out of view like the remnants of a forgotten dream. The crew says nothing, but the tension is palpable. The sight of these ghostly apparitions brings an uneasy quiet to the deck, and you can’t shake the feeling that you’re being watched.

No one speaks of the figures directly, but you catch murmurs among the crew—stories of the Bloodstone Pass and the horrors that once took place here. Tales of old battles, where entire armies were slaughtered, their spirits cursed to wander the cliffs forever. These specters, if that’s what they are, seem harmless for now, watching from a distance as your ship passes through.

It takes all night and most of the morning to pass through the Bloodstone Pass. 

    Gorak’s Tale (Gruff and Direct)
    As the ship passes the jagged cliffs of the Bloodstone Pass, the mist clings to the water, thick and eerie. Gorak, standing at the helm, notices the players eyeing the pale figures in the distance. With a grunt, he speaks, his voice low and gravelly, breaking the heavy silence.
    
    “Bloodstone Pass… this place ain’t for the weak-hearted.” He spits to the side, wiping his tusked mouth with the back of his hand. “Used to be an important trade route. Kept Damara fed, gold flowing between the villages and the cities. But it’s cursed, you know. Not many will tell you the story, but you lot seem like the kind to want the truth.”
    He keeps his eyes forward, steering the Sea Spray through the narrow pass as he talks.
    
    “A long time ago, back in the days when the land was younger and blood ran thicker than water, there was a great war. Not like the ones you hear about in taverns now. This was a war that tore the earth open, stained the ground red, and left thousands dead in these very cliffs. Two great armies—both claiming the land—clashed right here, in this pass. The fighting was savage. No prisoners. No mercy.
    
    "But what really cursed this place wasn’t just the blood that was spilled. It was what happened after. When the battle was over, the dead weren’t buried. The wounded were left to die. The pass became a graveyard, but the souls of the fallen didn’t find peace.”
    
    Gorak pauses, his eyes narrowing as he glances at the mist. For a moment, one of the ghostly figures seems to take shape near the shore before fading into the fog.
    
    “They say the spirits of the dead still walk these cliffs, cursed to relive their final moments, forever trapped in the mist. Ghosts of soldiers, warriors, and innocents alike. They’ll watch you pass, but don’t look too close. Some say the eyes of the dead can pull you in, make you join them. And trust me, lad—no one wants to join them.” He spits again, steering the ship through the narrowing path as the dark cliffs loom overhead.


The Ruins of Bloodstone Village
By midday on the fourth day, the mist has cleared, and the river widens as you come into view of the ruins of Bloodstone Village. The village is little more than a cluster of burned-out structures, their charred timbers black against the snow-covered ground. The remnants of the town stand as a silent testament to a tragedy long forgotten by the world, but felt deeply here.

The Sea Spray passes by quietly. The dock, long since crumbled and useless, juts out like a skeletal hand reaching for the river. The houses are little more than dark, hollow shells, their windows like empty eyes staring into the distance. You feel the weight of the place pressing down on you—the heavy sense of loss and abandonment that permeates the very air. 

The wind whistles through the skeletal remains of the buildings, and as you pass, you swear you see something—a fleeting movement behind a collapsed roof. But when you turn to look, there’s nothing there. Only silence. The village, long dead, seems to cling to whatever life it can, a memory of a time when it was more than just a ruin. Your gaze is drawn toward Captain Reaven standing at the bow watching

    Captain Reaven’s Tale (Calm and Reflective)
    Later, as the Sea Spray passes by the blackened ruins of Bloodstone Village, Captain Reaven stands at the bow, her emerald eyes focused on the distant, crumbling buildings. After a long silence, she speaks, her voice soft but laced with the weight of memory.
    
    “This village… it was once a thriving place, known as Bloodstone Village. It wasn’t always this way—burned out, empty, and forgotten. Once, it was full of life. Merchants, farmers, and soldiers all called it home. It served as the final stop for caravans traveling through the Bloodstone Pass. But as you can see, there’s not much left now.”
    
    She lets the silence linger, then turns slightly to the players, her tail flicking in the cold wind.
    
    “The village was abandoned many centuries ago, during a time of great upheaval. Back then, this region was caught between the powers of Damara and Vaasa, both vying for control. Bloodstone Village became a battleground in the middle of it all. When the war spilled into the pass, the village was caught in the crossfire. They say it was set ablaze, not by invaders, but by the very people sworn to protect it. A desperate act to prevent the enemy from claiming its resources.”
    
    Reaven’s eyes darken, her voice growing quieter. “But there’s more to it than that. There were whispers of something darker at work. After the fires died down and the village was left to smolder, strange things started happening. The dead didn’t stay dead, and the survivors… they didn’t stay long. They claimed to see figures in the smoke, hear voices in the wind. Some say it’s the souls of those who perished here, never able to leave. Others believe it’s the curse of the pass, spreading its fingers into the village.”
    
    She pauses, her hand resting lightly on the ship’s railing. “It’s said that anyone who dares to stay the night in Bloodstone Village is haunted by the past—reliving the night the fires consumed it. Few have dared, and fewer still have lived to tell the tale.”
    Her eyes drift back to the village as it slowly fades from view. “Best to leave it behind. Some places are meant to stay in the past.”
